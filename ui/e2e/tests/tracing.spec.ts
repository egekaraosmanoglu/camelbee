   * error and can put a bar visibly to the left of the caller still waiting on it. `nestBars` and
   * the flow bounds in `waterfall.ts` correct that.
   *
   * Unit tests cover the arithmetic by engineering the tie by hand. This is here because the
   * condition itself - genuine same-millisecond rounding across nested sub-millisecond `direct:`
   * hops - is a property of a real running Camel context, not of a fixture. The sample's
   * `direct:invokeX` -> `mock:X` pairs are exactly that shape, and the http hop to /api/health gives
   * the flow enough real duration to have a scale to be wrong against.
   *
   * The assertions are invariants, so they hold whether or not any given run happens to produce an
   * inversion. That is the point: they cannot be satisfied by luck the way an equality could.
