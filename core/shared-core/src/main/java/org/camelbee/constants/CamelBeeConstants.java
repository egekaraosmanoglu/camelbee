   * <p>Never rewriting is the entire point. Exchange properties are carried into copies, so a copy
   * inherits the root's id and reports it as its parent. The aggregating EIPs (multicast, enrich,
   * pollEnrich, recipientList) then copy the branch's properties BACK onto the original when
   * merging results - and because the branch never changed this value, what flows back is the value
   * the original already had. Anything that did change per-exchange would corrupt the original here,
   * which is exactly what an earlier attempt built on {@link #PREVIOUS_EXCHANGE_ID} did: the root
   * ended up parented to its own grandchild, producing cycles.
   *
   * <p>Used only as the fallback. {@code ExchangePropertyKey.CORRELATION_ID} is preferred where
   * Camel sets it, because it names the immediate parent rather than the lineage root; it is absent
   * exactly for wireTap, which removes it from the copy.
