# CamelBee - Apache Camel Library for Microservices Monitoring and Debugging in the CamelBee WebGL Application

CamelBee java core libraries are engineered to extract the architecture of Camel Routes, pinpoint endpoints, and map out the interconnections among them
to visualize the topology within either the CamelBee WebGL application (https://www.camelbee.io) or through the local Docker version (accessed at http://localhost:8083 by executing 'docker run -d -p 8083:80 camelbee/webgl').

## Features

### Route Visualization
- Effortlessly visualize complex Camel routes and their interconnections for a better understanding of your microservice architecture.
- Gain a clear overview of message routing and flow paths within your application.

### Message Tracing
- Trace messages as they traverse through Camel routes, enabling real-time debugging and issue identification.
- Detect bottlenecks, errors, or unexpected behavior in your message processing.

### Debugging and Replay
- Debug Camel routes interactively by inspecting message contents, and analyzing route behavior.
- Replay debug sessions to reproduce and investigate issues.
- Navigate through the debugging session's timeline, moving back and forth, to thoroughly analyze the process flow.

### Filtering
- Seamlessly filter messages to display only the relevant ones.

### Trigger Consumer Endpoints
- Initiate any kind of consumer endpoints direclty from the 3D environment and track message traffic.

### Real-time Monitoring
- Monitor Camel microservices with essential metrics and variables, ensuring the health and performance of your application.
- Retrieve comprehensive metrics data to keep your microservices running smoothly.
- Concurrently invoke consumer endpoints to conduct a stress test.
